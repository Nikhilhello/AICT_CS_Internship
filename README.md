# AICT_Cyber Security(CS)_Internship_JAN-2025
This project was developed as part of the **Edunet Foundation internship**, a **6-week program** from **January 15, 2025**, to **February 26, 2025**. 


# 🛡️ Steganography and Encryption Tool

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **Steganography and Encryption Tool** that allows users to **securely hide messages inside images** using **Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding**. Additionally, messages are **encrypted with a password** to ensure data security.

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Steganography + Encryption** – Dual-layer security to protect hidden messages.  
✅ **Password Protection** – Uses **Bcrypt hashing** for secure authentication.  
✅ **User-Friendly GUI** – Built with **Tkinter** for easy interaction.  
✅ **Cross-Platform Support** – Runs on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  
✅ **Supports PNG & JPG** – Hide and retrieve messages from images.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have Python installed. Download from: [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/)  

### **2️⃣ Install Required Libraries**  
Run the following command in the terminal:  
```bash
pip install pillow stegano cryptography bcrypt
```
Run the program:
```
image.py
```

### **3️⃣ Running the Application**
- Open the project folder in VS Code or IDLE.      
- Select an image, enter a message, and encrypt it!

### **🔑 Usage Guidelines**    
**For Encryption:**            
--> Choose a clear PNG/JPG image.             
--> Enter a strong password to protect the message.                     
--> Save the encoded image for future retrieval.                        
**For Decryption:**                         
--> Load the encoded image into the tool.                 
--> Enter the correct password to reveal the message.  

**⚠ Note:** If the wrong password is entered, decryption will fail!
